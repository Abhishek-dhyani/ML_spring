# ML_spring

Machine Learning course in Spring offered by Mingchen Gao. 
Coded in Python using Numpy, Tensorflow and Keras

Algorithms include
• Linear Discriminant Analysis
• Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
• Linear Regression
• Logistic Regression
• Ridge Regression
• Multi Layer Neural Network 
• Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflow

All the algorithms have been implemented from scratch. 

Additionally, we completed celebrity identification using the CNN module above.
